# Set up Java

Download JRE 17, and point JAVA_HOME to the folder that contains bin, lib, etc.

# Setup Android

Install Android SDK from https://developer.android.com/studio
Install the SDK for android 7, command line tools, build tools, platform tools, and emulator support. Then in android studio you can manage your devices.
Running the React-native project will start up an emulator for you, so you don't need to have android studio open.
ANDROID_HOME should point towards your sdk folder, where it has the cmdline-tools, platform-tools, and platforms folders.
