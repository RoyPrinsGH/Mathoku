If you wanna develop just run the mathoku dev console
I personally tend to set a PATH variable to whatever project I'm currently working on so I can just type 'dev' from any terminal and open the dev console for that project
That's why there is a dev.bat

Sadly the gradle bullshit has to be checked in or else we get another installation step, namely installing gradle and then running the gradle wrapper builder script

And oh yeah it's called mathoku_ui instead of mathoku-ui because react native init refused to accept it as an acceptable name
